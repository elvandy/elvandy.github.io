I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at [Computational Social Affective Neuroscience Laboratory](http://cosanlab.com) in the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu), Dartmouth College. I take an interdisciplinary approach, including machine learning, neuroimaging, and computational modeling to study social interactions and their impact on beliefs, feelings, and behaviors in cross-cultural and clinical contexts.

Before moving to the U.S., I completed my training as a licensed clinical psychologist in Taiwan. In 2017, I received my Ph.D. at Dartmouth College. During my doctoral training, I examine the acculturation processes of immigrants as they adapt to a new culture, allowing us to understand their social and affective experiences during acculturation. Besides of my research in acculturation, I developed a smartphone app called Appetite Tamer to help dieters change their dieting behaviors.

In February 2020, I will join the faculty at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html) as an assistant professor in [Department of Psychology](http://www.psy.ntu.edu.tw/index.php/eng) in [Taipei](https://www.travel.taipei), Taiwan. I will have positions available for lab manager, research assistant, master student, and PhD student. If you are interetsed in studying social interactions in cross-cultural and clinical contexts by using innovative computational methods, please contact me.
