I am currently an assistant professor in the [Department of Psychology](http://www.psy.ntu.edu.tw/index.php/eng) at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html) in [Taipei](https://www.travel.taipei), Taiwan. I am also the director of the [Computational Human-sociocultural Experimental Neuroscience (CHEN) Lab](https://www.chenlaboratory.com). I take an interdisciplinary approach, including machine learning, neuroimaging, and computational modeling to study social interactions and their impact on beliefs, feelings, and behaviors in cross-cultural and clinical contexts. If you are interested in joining the lab or collaborating on cross-cultural projects, please contact me or see more details on [CHEN lab](https://www.chenlaboratory.com).
